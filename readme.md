# Basic Blockchain in Python## This follows the blockchain a-z course on udemy### ...with some slight changes to make is fun    This is my first attempt at creating a blockchain and im also not familiar with a lot of python, and this is wrote in python so forgive some of the syntaxor not best practive mistakes in the code. This blockchain is not secure enoughto go live and at the time of writing has no web Ui to go with it. Use postmanto make the GET requests
